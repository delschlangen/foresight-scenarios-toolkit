# Contingency Planning: Scenario Response Playbooks

Pre-developed responses enable rapid action when scenarios shift. This document provides templates for building scenario-specific contingency plans.

---

## Why Contingency Planning Matters

When a critical indicator triggers or scenario probability shifts dramatically, you don't have time to develop strategy from scratch. Pre-built playbooks enable:

- **Faster response** — Decisions are pre-made, just execute
- **Better quality** — Plans developed calmly, not in crisis
- **Organizational alignment** — Everyone knows the plan
- **Reduced panic** — The future feels less uncertain when you're prepared

## Contingency Plan Structure

Each scenario should have a playbook with:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    SCENARIO PLAYBOOK                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TRIGGER CONDITIONS                                         │
│  └── What indicators/thresholds activate this playbook?     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-30 days)                              │

## Playbook Activation Checklist

When activating a scenario playbook:

- [ ] Verify trigger conditions are met (not false positive)
- [ ] Confirm with secondary data source if possible
- [ ] Notify activation authority for approval
- [ ] Record activation decision and rationale
- [ ] Communicate activation to relevant stakeholders
- [ ] Assign action owners with deadlines
- [ ] Schedule first checkpoint review (Day 7)
- [ ] Update scenario probabilities in main tracking

---

## Playbook Maintenance

### Quarterly Review

Every quarter, review each playbook for:

- [ ] Are trigger conditions still relevant?
- [ ] Have any triggers been partially met?
- [ ] Are immediate actions still executable?
- [ ] Are resource assumptions still valid?
- [ ] Are dependencies still available?
- [ ] Have scenario dynamics changed?

### After Activation

If a playbook is activated (even partially):

- [ ] Document what worked and what didn't
- [ ] Update playbook based on lessons learned
- [ ] Assess whether activation was timely
- [ ] Identify early warning improvements
- [ ] Share learnings across organization

---

## Cross-Scenario Actions

Some actions make sense regardless of scenario. These should be **pre-positioned** rather than waiting for triggers:

| Action | Rationale | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Maintain 6-month compliance runway | Works in all scenarios | ✅ In place |
| Quarterly legal landscape review | Early warning system | ✅ In place |
| Relationship with key regulators | Access in any scenario | 🔄 In progress |
| Modular product architecture | Enables rapid adaptation | 📋 Planned |
| Cross-trained compliance team | Resilience | 📋 Planned |

---

## Decision Authority Matrix

| Trigger Type | Can Activate | Must Notify |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Single indicator threshold | VP Strategy | CSO |
| Probability > 50% | CSO | CEO, Board |
| Crisis event | CEO | Board (within 24 hrs) |
| Multiple scenario shift | CSO + CEO | Board |
