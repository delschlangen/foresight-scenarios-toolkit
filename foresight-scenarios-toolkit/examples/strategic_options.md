# Strategic Options by Scenario

**Example: AI/Tech Company Strategy Under Different Governance Futures**

This worked example shows how to develop scenario-specific strategic options and identify robust moves that work across futures.

---

## Current Strategic Context

**Organization:** Mid-size enterprise SaaS company integrating AI features
**Focal Question:** How should we approach AI development and deployment given governance uncertainty?

**Current Posture:**
- $50M annual AI R&D investment
- US-primary market (70%), EU secondary (20%), other (10%)
- Moving fast on AI features to maintain competitive position
- Basic compliance (GDPR), limited AI-specific governance
- Small AI safety team (3 people)

## Option Performance by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Coordinated Caution
*Incremental capability + Harmonized regulation*

| Option | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A. Capability-First | 2/5 | Regulatory moat forms; late compliance hurts |
| B. Balanced | 4/5 | Good positioning; neither over- nor under-invested |
| C. Compliance-First | 4/5 | Early compliance becomes advantage |
| D. Safety-First | 3/5 | Valued but perhaps overinvested |
| 1. US Focus | 2/5 | International standards require adaptation |
| 2. Dual Track | 3/5 | Works but complex |
| 3. EU Standard | 5/5 | EU template becomes global; early advantage |
| 4. Multi-Modal | 4/5 | Flexibility valued |

**Best Combination:** C + 3 (Compliance-First, EU Standard)

---

### Scenario 2: Emergency Coordination
*Discontinuous capability + Harmonized regulation*

| Option | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A. Capability-First | 1/5 | Crisis triggers restrictions; caught overexposed |
| B. Balanced | 3/5 | Moderate positioning helps |
| C. Compliance-First | 3/5 | Compliance focus valued but frameworks change rapidly |
| D. Safety-First | 5/5 | Safety investment becomes differentiator |
| 1. US Focus | 2/5 | Crisis drives international coordination |
| 2. Dual Track | 2/5 | Frameworks converge; complexity wasted |
| 3. EU Standard | 4/5 | Good baseline, may need enhancement |
| 4. Multi-Modal | 4/5 | Adaptability crucial |

**Best Combination:** D + 4 (Safety-First, Multi-Modal)

---

### Scenario 3: Patchwork Progress
*Incremental capability + Fragmented regulation*

| Option | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A. Capability-First | 4/5 | Speed matters; manage compliance case-by-case |
| B. Balanced | 4/5 | Flexibility to navigate fragmentation |
| C. Compliance-First | 2/5 | Overinvested for fragmented landscape |
| D. Safety-First | 2/5 | Market doesn't reward it |
| 1. US Focus | 4/5 | Maximize permissive market |
| 2. Dual Track | 4/5 | Right approach for fragmentation |
| 3. EU Standard | 2/5 | Overbuilt for markets that don't require it |
| 4. Multi-Modal | 5/5 | Essential for navigating fragmentation |

**Best Combination:** B + 4 (Balanced, Multi-Modal)

---

### Scenario 4: Fragmented Scramble
*Discontinuous capability + Fragmented regulation*

| Option | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A. Capability-First | 3/5 | Speed matters but volatility is dangerous |
| B. Balanced | 3/5 | Moderate positioning |
| C. Compliance-First | 1/5 | Compliance frameworks unclear; wasted investment |
| D. Safety-First | 3/5 | May not be rewarded but provides resilience |
| 1. US Focus | 4/5 | Maximize permissive environment |
| 2. Dual Track | 2/5 | Too slow for chaotic environment |
| 3. EU Standard | 1/5 | Overbuilt; competitive disadvantage |
| 4. Multi-Modal | 4/5 | Agility essential |

**Best Combination:** A/B + 4 (Capability-First or Balanced, Multi-Modal)

## Robustness Analysis

### Finding Robust Strategies

Calculate minimum score across scenarios:

| Option | CC | EC | PP | FS | Min | Max | Robustness |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------------|
| A. Capability-First | 2 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 4 | Low |
| **B. Balanced** | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | **3** | 4 | **High** |
| C. Compliance-First | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | Low |
| D. Safety-First | 3 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 5 | Medium |
| 1. US Focus | 2 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 4 | Medium |
| 2. Dual Track | 3 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 4 | Medium |
| 3. EU Standard | 5 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 5 | Low |
| **4. Multi-Modal** | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | **4** | 5 | **High** |

**Most Robust Combination:** B + 4 (Balanced investment, Multi-Modal architecture)

This combination performs well (3+/5) across all scenarios.

## Current Probability-Weighted Analysis

Current probabilities:
- Coordinated Caution: 20%
- Emergency Coordination: 10%
- Patchwork Progress: 45%
- Fragmented Scramble: 25%

### Expected Value Calculation

| Option | CC×.20 | EC×.10 | PP×.45 | FS×.25 | EV |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| A. Capability-First | 0.4 | 0.1 | 1.8 | 0.75 | 3.05 |
| **B. Balanced** | 0.8 | 0.3 | 1.8 | 0.75 | **3.65** |
| C. Compliance-First | 0.8 | 0.3 | 0.9 | 0.25 | 2.25 |
| D. Safety-First | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.9 | 0.75 | 2.75 |
| 1. US Focus | 0.4 | 0.2 | 1.8 | 1.0 | 3.4 |
| 2. Dual Track | 0.6 | 0.2 | 1.8 | 0.5 | 3.1 |
| 3. EU Standard | 1.0 | 0.4 | 0.9 | 0.25 | 2.55 |
| **4. Multi-Modal** | 0.8 | 0.4 | 2.25 | 1.0 | **4.45** |

**Probability-Weighted Best:** B + 4 (Balanced + Multi-Modal) = 3.65 + 4.45 = 8.1

## Strategic Recommendation

### Primary Strategy (Current Probabilities)

**Balanced Investment + Multi-Modal Architecture**

| Dimension | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Investment split | 50% capability, 30% compliance, 20% safety |
| Architecture | Modular, compliance-switchable by market |
| Market priority | US + EU dual track, single codebase |
| Talent focus | AI engineers + compliance specialists + safety researchers |

This strategy:
- Performs well under most likely scenario (Patchwork Progress)
- Maintains acceptable performance under all scenarios (minimum 3/5)
- Provides optionality to pivot if probabilities shift

---

### Contingent Adjustments

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Coordinated Caution probability > 35% | Increase compliance allocation to 40% |
| Emergency Coordination probability > 25% | Increase safety allocation to 35% |
| Patchwork Progress probability > 55% | Shift to capability-first (60%) |
| Fragmented Scramble probability > 35% | Prepare aggressive M&A for speed |

---

### No-Regret Actions

Regardless of scenario, do these now:

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Build modular compliance layer | Enables fast adaptation |
| Hire 2 AI safety specialists | Baseline capability for any scenario |
| Establish EU regulatory relationships | Early access regardless of outcome |
| Create scenario monitoring dashboard | Early warning system |
| Develop contingency playbooks | Ready to move when triggers hit |

---

### Actions to Avoid

| Action | Why to Avoid |
|--------|-------------|
| Bet everything on speed (100% capability) | Catastrophic if harmonized regulation emerges |
| Bet everything on compliance (100% compliance) | Competitive disadvantage if fragmentation persists |
| Build for single market only | Limits optionality |
| Ignore safety entirely | Downside risk in crisis scenarios |

## Decision Authority

| Probability Shift | Who Decides | Timeline |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Any scenario moves ±5% | Strategy team notes | Next monthly review |
| Any scenario moves ±10% | VP Strategy review | Within 1 week |
| Any scenario exceeds 50% | C-suite strategy session | Within 2 weeks |
| Trigger indicator fires | Execute pre-approved contingency | Immediately |
