## Step 1: Define Your Focal Question

The focal question shapes everything. A good focal question is:

| Characteristic | Good Example | Poor Example |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Specific** | "How should we position our EV battery business in Europe by 2030?" | "What will happen with EVs?" |
| **Strategic** | "Should we build, buy, or partner for supply chain resilience?" | "Will supply chains be disrupted?" |
| **Actionable** | "Where should we invest our $500M R&D budget?" | "What technologies will exist?" |
| **Time-bounded** | "What should our 2025-2030 strategy be?" | "What does the future hold?" |

### Focal Question Template

> **For [organization/role], what strategy should we pursue regarding [decision area] over the [time horizon], given uncertainty about [key factors]?**

**Examples:**
- "For our fintech startup, what market entry strategy should we pursue in Southeast Asia over the next 3 years, given uncertainty about digital currency regulation and incumbent response?"
- "For our manufacturing business, how should we adapt our supply chain by 2028, given uncertainty about trade policy and automation economics?"

---

## Step 2: Map Your Domain

Before identifying specific drivers, understand your domain's structure:

### Key Questions

1. **Who are the key actors?** (Companies, governments, consumers, etc.)
2. **What are the main dynamics?** (Competition, regulation, adoption curves, etc.)
3. **Where is change happening fastest?**
4. **What are the biggest unknowns?**
5. **What historical parallels exist?**

### Domain Mapping Canvas

## Step 3: Identify Drivers (STEEP+T Adaptation)

The STEEP+T framework works for most domains. Adapt categories as needed:

### Standard STEEP+T

| Category | Focus Areas |
|----------|-------------|
| **S**ocial | Demographics, values, behavior, culture, workforce |
| **T**echnological | Innovation, adoption, infrastructure, capabilities |
| **E**conomic | Markets, resources, business models, capital |
| **E**nvironmental | Climate, resources, sustainability, physical constraints |
| **P**olitical | Regulation, governance, geopolitics, policy |
| **T**hreat/Opportunity | Disruption, competition, risks, new entrants |

### Domain-Specific Adaptations

| Domain | Additional/Modified Categories |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Healthcare** | Epidemiological, Clinical, Payor |
| **Finance** | Monetary policy, Market structure, Systemic risk |
| **Energy** | Resource availability, Grid infrastructure, Transition dynamics |
| **Defense** | Geopolitical, Capability, Alliance structures |
| **Consumer** | Behavioral, Generational, Platform dynamics |

### Driver Analysis Template

For each driver:

| Field | Your Input |
|-------|------------|
| **Driver ID** | [e.g., T-01] |
| **Name** | |
| **Category** | [STEEP+T] |
| **Description** | What is this force? |
| **Current trend** | Which direction is it moving? |
| **Impact** (1-5) | How much could it affect the focal question? |
| **Uncertainty** (1-5) | How confident are we in the trajectory? |
| **Time horizon** | When will impact be felt? |
| **Key indicators** | What would signal change? |

---

## Step 4: Select Critical Uncertainties

### Selection Process

1. **Plot drivers** on Impact (Y) vs Uncertainty (X) grid
2. **Focus on upper-right quadrant** (high impact, high uncertainty)
3. **Select 2 drivers** that are:
   - Most impactful for your focal question
   - Genuinely uncertain
   - Relatively independent of each other

### Independence Check

| Test | Pass | Fail |
|------|------|------|
| Correlation | "If X happens, Y could still go either way" | "If X happens, Y definitely follows" |
| Causation | Different root causes | Same root cause |
| Actors | Different key decision-makers | Same decision-makers |

### Axis Framing

Frame each uncertainty as a **spectrum**, not a binary:

| Poor Framing | Good Framing |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Regulation: Yes or No" | "Regulatory intensity: Minimal ↔ Comprehensive" |
| "Technology works: True or False" | "Technology maturity: Incremental ↔ Transformational" |
| "Economy: Good or Bad" | "Economic conditions: Contraction ↔ Expansion" |

---

## Step 5: Build Scenarios

### Quadrant Assignment

```
                    AXIS 2: High Pole
                           ▲
                           │
         ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
         │                 │                 │
         │   SCENARIO 1    │   SCENARIO 2    │
         │   [Name]        │   [Name]        │
         │                 │                 │
AXIS 1:  │                 │                 │  AXIS 1:
Low Pole ◄─────────────────┼─────────────────► High Pole
         │                 │                 │
         │   SCENARIO 3    │   SCENARIO 4    │
         │   [Name]        │   [Name]        │
         │                 │                 │
         └─────────────────┼─────────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
                    AXIS 2: Low Pole
```

### Scenario Development Template

For each quadrant:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Evocative, memorable (2-3 words) |
| **Tagline** | One sentence capturing the essence |
| **Narrative** | 1-2 page story of how this world emerged |
| **Timeline** | Key events/milestones |
| **Key features** | 5-7 defining characteristics |
| **Winners** | Who thrives in this world? |
| **Losers** | Who struggles? |
| **Strategic implications** | What does this mean for our focal question? |

---

## Step 6: Define Indicators

For each scenario, identify 8-12 indicators:

### Indicator Mix

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Leading** | Early warning | VC investment patterns |
| **Confirming** | Validates shift | Policy announcements |
| **Lagging** | After-the-fact confirmation | Market share data |

### Indicator Template

| Field | Your Input |
|-------|------------|
| **ID** | [e.g., I-01] |
| **Signal** | What are we watching for? |
| **Source** | Where do we find this? |
| **Threshold** | What level triggers attention? |
| **Scenario linkage** | Which scenario does this support? |
| **Confidence** | How reliable is this signal? |
| **Frequency** | How often do we check? |

---

## Step 7: Operationalize

### Scanning Rhythm

| Frequency | Activity | Time Required |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Weekly | Quick indicator scan | 30-60 min |
| Monthly | Probability update | 1-2 hours |
| Quarterly | Deep scenario review | Half day |
| Annually | Full methodology refresh | 1-2 days |

### Integration Points

Connect foresight to decision-making:

- **Strategic planning:** Test strategies against scenarios
- **Risk management:** Map risks to scenario likelihoods
- **Investment decisions:** Weight by scenario probability
- **Contingency planning:** Pre-develop scenario responses

# Worked Example: Climate Transition for Energy Company

## Focal Question

> For a mid-size oil & gas company, what portfolio strategy should we pursue for the 2025-2035 period, given uncertainty about energy transition pace and policy direction?

---

## Domain Map

| Aspect | Elements |
|--------|----------|
| **Key actors** | IOCs, NOCs, utilities, governments, investors, consumers |
| **Key dynamics** | Decarbonization pressure, technology cost curves, energy security concerns |
| **Fast-moving** | Renewable costs, EV adoption, ESG pressure |
| **Slow-moving** | Infrastructure, workforce skills, demand patterns |
| **Unknowns** | Policy durability, technology breakthroughs, geopolitics |
| **Parallels** | Coal phase-out, previous energy transitions |

---

## Drivers Identified

| ID | Driver | Impact | Uncertainty |
|----|--------|--------|-------------|
| T-01 | Renewable energy cost curves | 5 | 2 |
| T-02 | Battery/storage technology | 4 | 4 |
| T-03 | Hydrogen economics | 4 | 5 |
| T-04 | Carbon capture viability | 3 | 5 |
| P-01 | Climate policy stringency | 5 | 4 |
| P-02 | Energy security priority | 4 | 4 |
| P-03 | Subsidy/incentive durability | 4 | 4 |
| E-01 | Oil demand trajectory | 5 | 3 |
| E-02 | Capital availability for transition | 4 | 3 |
| S-01 | Consumer/investor pressure | 4 | 3 |
| S-02 | Workforce transition readiness | 3 | 3 |
| Th-01 | Stranded asset risk | 5 | 4 |

---

## Critical Uncertainties Selected

### Axis 1: Energy Transition Pace
- **Low pole:** Gradual Transition — Fossil fuels remain significant through 2035
- **High pole:** Rapid Transition — Accelerated shift to renewables

**Rationale:** Highest impact on portfolio strategy; genuine uncertainty given conflicting pressures

### Axis 2: Policy Environment
- **Low pole:** Supportive — Strong, durable climate policies and incentives
- **High pole:** Volatile — Policy reversals, fragmented approaches, uncertain support

**Rationale:** Critical for investment decisions; independent of transition pace (fast transition could happen with or without policy support)

---

### Scenario 1: Managed Decline (Gradual + Supportive)

**Tagline:** "An orderly transition that takes longer than expected"

**Narrative:** Climate policies remain strong but the energy transition proves slower than projected. Renewable buildout faces infrastructure bottlenecks, and fossil fuels remain necessary through 2035. However, supportive policy creates clear glide paths for managed decline of hydrocarbon assets.

**Key Features:**
- 15-20 year runway for oil & gas
- Clear regulatory pathways for asset retirement
- Government support for workforce transition
- Gradual but predictable demand decline
- Premium for "transition-ready" assets

**Strategic Implications:**
- Maximize value from existing assets
- Invest moderately in low-carbon (CCS, hydrogen)
- Focus on operational efficiency
- Prepare orderly exit from high-cost assets

---

### Scenario 2: Green Acceleration (Rapid + Supportive)

**Tagline:** "Policy and technology combine for faster-than-expected transition"

**Narrative:** Breakthrough technology (storage, hydrogen) combines with strong policy to accelerate the energy transition dramatically. By 2030, the writing is on the wall for hydrocarbon assets. Strong policy provides some support for stranded assets but the transition is faster than companies can adapt.

**Key Features:**
- Oil demand peaks by 2027, declines rapidly
- Stranded asset risk materializes
- Massive capital reallocation to renewables
- Winners emerge quickly
- Workforce dislocation despite policy support

**Strategic Implications:**
- Urgent pivot to renewables/low-carbon
- Divest high-cost hydrocarbon assets immediately
- Acquire renewable capabilities aggressively
- Accept near-term write-downs

---

### Scenario 3: Muddle Through (Gradual + Volatile)

**Tagline:** "Slow transition with policy whiplash"

**Narrative:** Neither the transition nor policy support materializes as expected. Climate policy swings with election cycles. Renewables grow but face opposition. Fossil fuels remain important but investment climate is uncertain. Companies hedge constantly.

**Key Features:**
- Prolonged uncertainty
- Investment paralysis across sectors
- Policy reversals common
- Stranded asset risk unclear
- Returns to those who can navigate volatility

**Strategic Implications:**
- Maintain optionality
- Avoid large irreversible bets
- Diversify across energy types
- Focus on resilience over optimization

---

### Scenario 4: Market Disruption (Rapid + Volatile)

**Tagline:** "Technology disrupts faster than policy can respond"

**Narrative:** Technology cost curves accelerate transition regardless of policy. EVs, storage, and renewables become economically dominant. But policy support is absent—no help for stranded assets, no managed transition. Market forces drive chaotic, uneven disruption.

**Key Features:**
- Rapid demand destruction for fossil fuels
- No policy cushion for incumbents
- Winners and losers determined by adaptation speed
- Workforce dislocation without support
- High volatility, extreme outcomes

**Strategic Implications:**
- Aggressive transformation or exit
- Speed is everything
- No time for gradual transition
- Acquire or be disrupted

---

## Probability Assessment (Initial)

| Scenario | Probability | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Managed Decline | 30% | Most orderly; faces implementation challenges |
| Green Acceleration | 20% | Requires both technology and policy alignment |
| Muddle Through | 35% | Most common historical pattern |
| Market Disruption | 15% | Requires technology without policy; plausible |
