---

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

### 2 Weeks Before

| Task | Owner | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Define focal question | Facilitator + sponsor | Get executive alignment |
| Identify participants | Sponsor | 8-12 people ideal |
| Conduct pre-reading interviews | Facilitator | 30 min each with 4-6 participants |
| Prepare driver briefing | Facilitator | Research key forces |
| Book venue/setup tech | Admin | Whiteboard space critical |
| Send calendar invites with pre-work | Facilitator | Include reading materials |

### Participant Selection

Include a mix of:
- **Domain experts** — Deep knowledge of the space
- **Strategists** — Connect scenarios to decisions
- **Operators** — Ground truth on feasibility
- **Challengers** — Willing to push back on consensus
- **Decision-makers** — Authority to act on outputs

**Avoid:**
- All same department/function
- Only senior leaders (need diverse perspectives)
- More than 15 people (hard to facilitate)

### Pre-Work for Participants

Send 1 week before:

1. **Focal question** — What we're trying to answer
2. **Background reading** — 2-3 articles on key trends
3. **Driver brainstorm** — "List 5 forces shaping our focal question"
4. **Scenario example** — Sample scenario set (from this toolkit)

---

### Session 1: Opening & Context Setting (30 min)

**Purpose:** Align on focal question and methodology

**Agenda:**
1. Welcome and introductions (5 min)
2. Review focal question (10 min)
3. Explain methodology overview (10 min)
4. Set ground rules (5 min)

**Facilitator Script:**

> "Today we're going to build scenarios to help us answer: [FOCAL QUESTION].
>
> Scenarios are not predictions. They're plausible futures that help us stress-test our strategy and prepare for multiple possibilities.
>
> Our goal is to leave with: 4 distinct scenarios, initial probability estimates, and strategic implications."

**Ground Rules:**

- All ideas are valid in brainstorming
- No phones/laptops except for designated note-taker
- Build on others' ideas
- Challenge assumptions, not people
- Aim for "plausible" not "likely" or "preferred"

---

### Session 2: Driver Identification (90 min)

**Purpose:** Map forces shaping the future

**Materials:**
- Sticky notes (different colors for STEEP+T)
- Whiteboard or wall space
- Pre-prepared driver cards from pre-work

**Process:**

**Part A: Individual brainstorm (15 min)**
- Each person writes drivers on sticky notes (one per note)
- Use STEEP+T categories as prompts
- Aim for 8-10 drivers per person

**Part B: Clustering (25 min)**
- Post all stickies on wall
- Facilitator reads aloud, groups similar
- Name each cluster (becomes a driver)
- Aim to consolidate to 15-20 distinct drivers

**Part C: Impact/Uncertainty scoring (30 min)**
- Draw 2x2 grid on whiteboard (Impact vs Uncertainty)
- For each driver, group discussion: "High or low impact? High or low uncertainty?"
- Place drivers on grid
- No need for precise scores—rough placement is fine

**Part D: Discussion (20 min)**
- "What's missing from high-impact, high-uncertainty quadrant?"
- "Are any of these correlated (if X happens, Y definitely follows)?"
- "Which surprise you?"

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Keep energy high during clustering (stand, move around)
- Probe vague drivers: "What specifically do you mean by 'technology'?"
- Challenge consensus: "Does everyone agree this is low uncertainty?"

---

### Session 3: Uncertainty Selection (60 min)

**Purpose:** Choose 2 axes for scenario matrix

**Process:**

**Part A: Candidate review (15 min)**
- Focus on drivers in high-impact, high-uncertainty quadrant
- Identify 4-6 candidates for axes
- Brief discussion of each: "Why is this critical? Why uncertain?"

**Part B: Axis selection (30 min)**
- Evaluate candidates against criteria:
  - High impact on focal question
  - Genuinely uncertain
  - Independent of other axis
  - Creates differentiated worlds
- Use voting if needed (each person gets 3 votes)
- Select top 2

**Part C: Axis framing (15 min)**
- For each axis, define the poles
- Frame as spectrum: "Low pole ↔ High pole"
- Test with group: "Are these truly opposite ends?"
- Name the axes (clear, memorable labels)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Choosing axes that are too correlated
- Binary framing (yes/no instead of spectrum)
- Choosing "safe" axes that don't create challenging scenarios
- Axes that are too abstract to generate concrete scenarios

**Red Flag Phrases:**
- "If X happens, then Y definitely follows" → Correlated, choose different axis
- "This is basically the same as..." → Consolidate or choose one
- "We all agree this is going to happen" → Not uncertain enough

---

### Session 4: Scenario Development (90 min)

**Purpose:** Build narrative for each quadrant

**Setup:**
- Draw 2x2 matrix on whiteboard with axis labels
- Number quadrants 1-4
- Divide into 4 groups (2-3 people each)
- Assign each group a quadrant

**Process:**

**Part A: Group work (45 min)**

Each group develops their scenario using template:

1. **Name** — 2-3 word evocative title (5 min)
2. **Tagline** — One sentence summary (5 min)
3. **How we got here** — Key events/path to this world (15 min)
4. **What this world looks like** — 5-7 characteristics (15 min)
5. **Winners and losers** — Who thrives, who struggles? (5 min)

**Part B: Presentations (40 min)**
- Each group presents their scenario (7-8 min each)
- Brief Q&A after each
- Other groups note: "What's missing? Does this feel plausible?"

**Part C: Consistency check (5 min)**
- Facilitator leads quick review:
  - "Are scenarios sufficiently different?"
  - "Do any overlap too much?"
  - "Is any scenario implausible?"

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Circulate during group work to unstick groups
- Push for concrete details: "What headlines would we see in 2028?"
- Challenge scenarios that are "good" or "bad" without nuance
- Remind: scenarios are possibilities, not predictions or preferences

---

### Session 5: Scenario Refinement (60 min)

**Purpose:** Strengthen and differentiate scenarios

**Process:**

**Part A: Cross-pollination (25 min)**
- Rotate groups: each visits another scenario station
- Visiting group adds:
  - 2 additional characteristics
  - 1 potential weakness/implausibility
  - 1 "wild card" event that could occur in this scenario

**Part B: Plenary refinement (25 min)**
- Review each scenario with full group
- Address weaknesses/implausibilities
- Ensure internal consistency
- Finalize names and taglines

**Part C: Probability calibration (10 min)**
- As a group, assign rough probabilities (must sum to 100%)
- This is a starting point—will refine with indicators
- Capture dissenting views if no consensus

**Probability Discussion Prompts:**
- "Which scenario feels most likely from today's vantage point?"
- "Which would surprise you most?"
- "Are we anchoring too much on one scenario?"

---

### Session 6: Strategic Implications (45 min)

**Purpose:** Connect scenarios to decisions

**Process:**

**Part A: Individual reflection (10 min)**

Each person answers:
- "Which scenario is best for our organization?"
- "Which is worst?"
- "What should we do if [best scenario] emerges?"
- "What should we do if [worst scenario] emerges?"

**Part B: Group discussion (25 min)**
- Share reflections
- Identify common themes
- Discuss: "What actions make sense across multiple scenarios?" (robust moves)
- Discuss: "What actions only make sense for specific scenarios?" (contingent moves)

**Part C: Capture (10 min)**
- Document key strategic implications
- Identify open questions for further analysis
- Note disagreements (don't force consensus)

---

### Session 7: Next Steps & Close (30 min)

**Purpose:** Commit to action and follow-up

**Agenda:**

1. **Summary** — Recap 4 scenarios and key insights (5 min)
2. **Next steps** — Agree on follow-up actions (15 min)
3. **Feedback** — Quick round of what worked/didn't (5 min)
4. **Close** — Thank participants, set expectations (5 min)

**Typical Next Steps:**

| Action | Owner | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Document scenarios in full | Facilitator | 1 week |
| Develop indicator register | Facilitator + 1-2 participants | 2 weeks |
| Brief leadership on outputs | Sponsor | 2 weeks |
| Schedule quarterly review | Facilitator | Before leaving workshop |
| Begin weekly scanning | Assigned analyst | Immediately |

## Remote Workshop Adaptations

### Technology Setup

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Video conferencing | Main session (Zoom, Teams) |
| Digital whiteboard | Driver clustering, scenario matrix (Miro, Mural) |
| Shared doc | Real-time note-taking |
| Breakout rooms | Group scenario work |
| Timer | Keep sessions on track |

### Modified Agenda

For remote, use shorter sessions across multiple days:

**Day 1 (2.5 hours):**
- Opening & Context (30 min)
- Driver Identification (90 min)
- Break (15 min)
- Uncertainty Selection (45 min)

**Day 2 (2.5 hours):**
- Recap (15 min)
- Scenario Development (90 min)
- Break (15 min)
- Scenario Refinement (45 min)

**Day 3 (1.5 hours):**
- Recap (15 min)
- Strategic Implications (45 min)
- Next Steps & Close (30 min)

### Remote Facilitation Tips

- More explicit turn-taking (call on people by name)
- Use chat for brainstorming alongside verbal
- More frequent breaks (every 45-60 min)
- Pre-create templates in digital whiteboard
- Send clear joining instructions
- Have backup facilitator for tech issues

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### "We can't agree on uncertainties"

**Solution:**
- Use anonymous voting
- If still split, try 3-axis framework (more complex but accommodates more views)
- Note that disagreement often signals genuine uncertainty (good sign!)

### "All scenarios feel the same"

**Solution:**
- Push for more extreme poles on axes
- Ask: "What's the craziest but still plausible version?"
- Have groups present to each other and identify overlaps

### "People are stuck in prediction mode"

**Solution:**
- Remind: "We're not forecasting, we're exploring possibilities"
- Ask: "What would have to be true for this world to exist?"
- Use improv technique: "Yes, and..."

### "One person dominates"

**Solution:**
- Use individual brainstorm before group discussion
- Anonymous voting
- Explicitly invite quieter voices: "Sarah, what's your take?"
- Breakout groups dilute dominant voices

### "Scenarios are too rosy/too gloomy"

**Solution:**
- Require each scenario to have winners AND losers
- Challenge: "Who benefits in this scenario? Who suffers?"
- Separate "desirable" from "plausible"

### "Leadership isn't taking it seriously"

**Solution:**
- Connect explicitly to upcoming decisions
- Present scenarios as stress-test, not abstract exercise
- Show how competitors are using foresight
- Start with pilot, demonstrate value
