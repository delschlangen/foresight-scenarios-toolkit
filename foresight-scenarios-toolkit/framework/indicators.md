| **What to watch** | Resignation letters citing safety concerns; public warnings; regulatory testimony |
| **Source** | Social media, press coverage, Congressional testimony |
| **Threshold** | Multiple senior departures with safety rationale → supports Emergency scenarios |
| **Scenario linkage** | Departures + concern → Emergency Coordination; Business as usual → Caution/Patchwork |

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Signal** | Progress of comprehensive federal AI legislation through Congress |
| **What to watch** | Bill introductions, committee hearings, floor votes, presidential statements |
| **Source** | Congress.gov, press coverage, lobbyist activity |
| **Threshold** | Comprehensive bill passage → supports Harmonized axis; Continued inaction → Fragmented |
