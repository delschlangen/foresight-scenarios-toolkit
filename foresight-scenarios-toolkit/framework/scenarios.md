## Scenario 1: Coordinated Caution

**Quadrant:** Incremental Capability + Harmonized Regulation

**Tagline:** "The world agrees on AI guardrails before the horse leaves the barn."

### Narrative

By 2027, frontier AI capabilities have continued advancing but without the dramatic leaps some predicted. Scaling laws hit diminishing returns around 2026, and while AI systems are more capable than GPT-4, they remain tools that augment rather than replace human judgment in high-stakes domains.

This breathing room allowed international coordination to mature. The EU AI Act served as a template, and after bruising negotiations, the US, EU, and key Asian economies reached a mutual recognition agreement on AI safety standards in 2028. China remains outside the framework but implements comparable domestic requirements for systems serving its market.

### Key Features

- International AI Safety Board (modeled on IAEA) established
- Tiered licensing for high-capability models
- Mandatory pre-deployment safety evaluations for frontier systems
- Harmonized incident reporting across jurisdictions
- Compute thresholds trigger regulatory scrutiny

### Winners & Losers

| Winners | Losers |
|---------|--------|
| Large incumbent AI labs (compliance moat) | Startups (regulatory burden) |
| GRC/compliance professionals | Open-source purists |
| Risk-averse enterprises | Move-fast cultures |
| International institutions | National sovereignty advocates |

### Strategic Implications

- **For AI developers:** Invest heavily in compliance infrastructure; safety becomes competitive advantage
- **For deployers:** Clearer compliance pathway but higher costs
- **For policymakers:** Template exists; focus on implementation
- **For civil society:** Seat at the table through formal processes

## Scenario 2: Emergency Coordination

**Quadrant:** Discontinuous Capability + Harmonized Regulation

**Tagline:** "A crisis forces cooperation that seemed impossible."

### Narrative

In late 2026, a frontier lab achieves a significant capability discontinuity—an AI system demonstrating genuine recursive self-improvement and autonomous goal pursuit. The initial deployment causes no catastrophe, but the implications are immediately clear to technical experts and policymakers alike.

Faced with an obvious and present risk, geopolitical rivals find unprecedented common ground. Within 18 months, emergency international frameworks emerge—imperfect and contested, but functional. The memory of near-catastrophe drives sustained cooperation despite ongoing tensions.

### Key Features

- Mandatory compute reporting and controls globally
- International inspection regime for frontier facilities
- Shared "circuit breaker" protocols for concerning capabilities
- Aggressive restrictions on autonomous agentic deployment
- Massive public investment in AI safety research

### Winners & Losers

| Winners | Losers |
|---------|--------|
| AI safety researchers | "Move fast" advocates |
| Governments (expanded authority) | Lab autonomy |
| Defensive/security applications | Consumer AI applications (slowed) |
| Incumbent frontier labs | Challenger labs |

### Strategic Implications

- **For AI developers:** Safety-first is non-negotiable; expect intensive oversight
- **For deployers:** Limited access to frontier capabilities; focus on narrow applications
- **For policymakers:** Crisis creates mandate but implementation is chaotic
- **For civil society:** Urgency creates openings for influence

## Scenario 3: Patchwork Progress

**Quadrant:** Incremental Capability + Fragmented Regulation

**Tagline:** "AI advances steadily while governance remains a mess."

### Narrative

AI capabilities continue their incremental advance through 2030, but international governance coordination never materializes. The EU enforces the AI Act strictly, the US maintains sector-specific voluntary frameworks, China pursues state-directed development, and emerging markets vary widely.

Companies adapt to this patchwork, building compliance capabilities for key markets while taking advantage of regulatory arbitrage where possible. Progress continues but is slowed by friction; no catastrophic failures occur, but neither does coherent global governance.

### Key Features

- EU as de facto global standard for companies wanting market access
- US innovation hub with minimal federal requirements
- Compliance complexity as major business cost
- "Good enough" safety through market pressure and liability risk
- Regulatory arbitrage for some applications

### Winners & Losers

| Winners | Losers |
|---------|--------|
| Large multinationals (compliance scale) | SMEs (compliance burden) |
| Legal/compliance industry | Efficiency advocates |
| Permissive jurisdictions | Strict jurisdictions (some) |
| Pragmatic deployers | Idealists (safety or innovation) |

### Strategic Implications

- **For AI developers:** Build modular compliance; design for strictest market
- **For deployers:** Jurisdiction shopping is real but limited
- **For policymakers:** Focus on domestic frameworks; international coordination is aspirational
- **For civil society:** National-level advocacy most effective

## Scenario 4: Fragmented Scramble

**Quadrant:** Discontinuous Capability + Fragmented Regulation

**Tagline:** "Transformative AI arrives in a world unprepared to govern it."

### Narrative

A discontinuous capability advance occurs—but unlike Scenario 2, no coordinated response emerges. Geopolitical competition intensifies rather than abates; nations rush to secure advantage rather than cooperate on safety. The US and China view frontier AI as decisive for strategic competition and resist any constraints.

The result is a dangerous period of rapid capability deployment with minimal guardrails. Some nations attempt strict controls but face circumvention. Others embrace unrestricted development. The international system fragments further under pressure.

### Key Features

- AI arms race dynamics dominate
- Regulatory arbitrage at massive scale
- Safety concerns subordinated to competitive pressures
- High variance in outcomes—some beneficial, some harmful deployments
- Crisis-driven ad hoc responses rather than systematic governance

### Winners & Losers

| Winners | Losers |
|---------|--------|
| First movers (short term) | Everyone (long term risk) |
| Permissive jurisdictions | Cautious jurisdictions |
| State-aligned actors | Independent actors |
| Defense/intelligence | Civil society |

### Strategic Implications

- **For AI developers:** Speed dominates; safety is afterthought
- **For deployers:** High reward, high risk; prepare for volatility
- **For policymakers:** National security frame dominates; governance is reactive
- **For civil society:** Limited influence; focus on harm mitigation

## Scenario Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Coordinated Caution | Emergency Coordination | Patchwork Progress | Fragmented Scramble |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| AI capability pace | Incremental | Discontinuous | Incremental | Discontinuous |
| Governance coherence | High | High (crisis-driven) | Low | Very low |
| Innovation speed | Moderate | Constrained | Moderate | Unconstrained |
| Safety posture | Proactive | Reactive but strong | Ad hoc | Weak |
| Geopolitical tension | Managed | Reduced by crisis | Persistent | Escalated |
| Best preparation | Compliance investment | Safety + flexibility | Market diversification | Agility + resilience |

## Using These Scenarios

### For Strategic Planning

1. Assess current strategy against each scenario
2. Identify vulnerabilities in worst-case scenarios
3. Find "robust" moves that work across multiple scenarios
4. Develop contingency triggers for scenario-specific responses

### For Risk Management

1. Map existing risks to scenario likelihoods
2. Identify scenario-specific risks not currently tracked
3. Stress test controls against each scenario
4. Build monitoring for scenario indicators

### For Policy Advocacy

1. Identify which scenario best serves your interests
2. Develop advocacy strategy to increase that scenario's likelihood
3. Prepare positions for less favorable scenarios
4. Build coalitions with aligned stakeholders
